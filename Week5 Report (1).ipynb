    "4. Initial plan was to use in Foursquare the query = ‘kid’ or ‘child’, however, the result is too few. The query used was ‘family’ instead. This does not totally change the focus of the problem since the objective was to find a location to put up a ‘kid-friendly’ restaurant. Changing the keyword to ‘family’ somehow widens the exploration of venues in Foursquare.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Foursquare returned values of the exploration for all boroughs, which means there is no borough where the idea of ’family’ oriented  cannot be found.\n",
